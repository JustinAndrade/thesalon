Let‚Äôs keep our fingers crossed we will be seeing each other soon! If you would like an appointment for reopening, please message @thesalon_nb on IG or on our Facebook ‚ÄòThe Salon‚Äô! Appointments will be scheduled in the order in which they are received! (First dibs on appointment times/dates the sooner you reach out!) We hope everyone has been safe & healthy during this and cannot wait to see everyone back at our salon homeü§çxoxo
